TABLE B8: POST-2007 INTERACTION TEST - ISOLATING REGULATORY EFFECT FROM INDUSTRY EFFECT
Dependent Variable: 30-Day Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR)
Tests whether FCC penalty emerges after 2007 regulation (supporting causal effect) or existed before (industry effect)

Notes: FCC regulation (47 CFR § 64.2011) became effective in 2007. If the FCC penalty reflects regulatory burden,
the coefficient should be non-significant pre-2007 and significant post-2007. If the penalty reflects industry
characteristics, the coefficient should be similar across both periods.

Key Finding: FCC effect emerges after regulation (Model 3 > Model 2), supporting interpretation that
the penalty comes from regulatory constraints, not pre-existing industry characteristics.
