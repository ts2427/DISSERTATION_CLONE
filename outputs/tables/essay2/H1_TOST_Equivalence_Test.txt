H1 ROBUSTNESS: TWO ONE-SIDED TESTS (TOST) EQUIVALENCE TEST
Tests whether H1 (timing) effect is statistically equivalent to zero
====================================================================================================

COEFFICIENT ESTIMATES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H1 Coefficient (Immediate Disclosure):      0.5676%
Standard Error (clustered):                 0.9244%
t-statistic:                               0.6140
p-value (two-tailed):                      0.5392
Degrees of freedom:                           893

EQUIVALENCE TEST SETUP:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equivalence Bound (delta):               ±2.10 percentage points
Interpretation: Effects between -2.10% and +2.10% are economically negligible
Confidence Level:                        90% (standard for TOST)

EQUIVALENCE TEST RESULTS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
90% Confidence Interval:                 [-0.9545%,  2.0896%]
Lower Bound Test (CI > -2.10%):     True (PASS)
Upper Bound Test (CI < +2.10%):     True (PASS)
EQUIVALENCE CONCLUSION:                  YES

INTERPRETATION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 90% confidence interval for the H1 timing effect falls entirely within the
equivalence bounds of ±2.10%. This means the true effect of immediate disclosure
on market returns is statistically equivalent to zero for practical purposes.

The evidence supports THREE conclusions simultaneously:
1. Disclosure timing is NOT statistically significant (p=0.539)
2. Timing effects are NOT economically meaningful (within ±2.10% bound)
3. This null finding is ROBUST and not due to lack of statistical power

This represents strong evidence that disclosure timing does not affect market reactions,
contrary to the assumptions underlying current disclosure regulations.

TOST METHODOLOGY NOTE:
====================================================================================================
Traditional significance testing (t-test) can fail to reject null when power is low.
TOST equivalence testing goes further: it actively tests whether the observed effect
is small enough to be considered equivalent to zero. Passing TOST means the null
finding is robust and not merely a power issue.
