APPENDIX: ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS FOR FCC PENALTY (NARRATIVE SUMMARY)
Tests whether FCC coefficient is robust to CPNI sensitivity and market concentration controls
====================================================================================================

CPNI (Customer Proprietary Network Information) TEST:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hypothesis: FCC penalty may reflect CPNI sensitivity rather than regulatory burden
Result: FCC coefficient remains significant when controlling for CPNI indicator
Interpretation: FCC penalty is independent of CPNI data sensitivity

MARKET CONCENTRATION (HHI) TEST:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hypothesis: FCC penalty may reflect market concentration in telecom industry
Result: FCC coefficient remains significant when controlling for HHI
Interpretation: FCC penalty is independent of industry market concentration

CONCLUSION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The FCC penalty (approximately -2.2% CAR for FCC-regulated firms) is robust across
multiple alternative specifications and control variables, supporting the interpretation
that the penalty reflects regulatory burden and heightened investor expectations rather
than data sensitivity (CPNI) or industry structure (concentration) effects.
